# SocialTwin × Base MCP — Integration (DESIGN ONLY)

> **Status: 🔒 Internal design. NOT built, NOT deployed, NOT published.**
> This folder is the implementation plan only. Nothing here is live. Do not publish the
> skill to npm / the Base skills registry, and do not advertise the resource server, until
> we explicitly cut over (see [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) §Secrecy & staging).

## What we're building

A **Base MCP Skill** (with a small x402-gated backend) that lets any Base MCP user — in
Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc. — do three things by talking to their agent:

| # | Capability | One-liner | How it's powered |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Resolve** | "what's the twin address for twitch.tv/yougotcoined?" | our `/resolve` endpoint → Twitch user_id → `factory.predictAddress` |
| 2 | **Tip** | "tip 5 USDC to twitch.tv/yougotcoined" | resolve → Base MCP's native **`send`** tool to the twin address |
| 3 | **Launch** | "launch a coin for twitch.tv/somestreamer" | resolve → **x402** `POST /launch` (we charge **$1 USDC** as anti-spam) |

Tipping needs **no new on-chain contract** — a tip is just a `send` of ETH/USDC to the
streamer's twin address, which the streamer later claims with their Twitch login through the
existing SocialTwin flow. Tips even work **before** the twin is deployed (CREATE2 address holds
funds pre-deploy). Launch is the only paid action, and x402 is what monetizes that one API call.

## Why a Skill (not our own MCP server) — first cut

Base MCP is now a **hosted remote server** (`https://mcp.base.org`) with OAuth + Base Account
approvals and a **markdown Skill** layer. A Skill is the lowest-friction unit: it's prompt-level
instructions that orchestrate Base MCP's existing tools (`get_wallets`, `send`, `send_calls`,
`web_request`, typed-data signing) plus our HTTP endpoints. We add **zero** wallet/key
infrastructure and inherit Base Account's approval UX for every value-moving step.

The one place this is uncertain is the **x402 payment path for Launch** — see
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §"x402 path decision". If Base MCP's client can't drive
the 402 flow itself, we fall back to a thin companion (a small x402-enabled MCP server / plugin)
for the Launch tool only. Resolve + Tip are skill-only regardless.
